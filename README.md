📖 How to Use
1. Analyze Coconut Leaf Image
Go to "Detect Disease" section
Upload a clear image of the affected leaf
Choose analysis model:
Gemini: Cloud-based AI
Local: PyTorch model
Combined YOLO: Both YOLO models together
Get instant diagnosis with confidence score
2. Get Treatment Recommendations
After analysis, view recommended products
Click links to purchase products directly
Read treatment guidelines from Gemini AI
3. Find Local Experts
Enable location services
View agricultural experts near you
Contact them for personalized advice
4. Manage Products
Admin: Go to Product Management
Add treatment products by disease category
Include purchase links for easy shopping
5. Contact Us
Fill contact form with your inquiry
Messages are sent via EmailJS
Get timely responses from the team
🔧 Backend API Endpoints
Disease Analysis
POST /predict - Run dual YOLO models on image

Body: FormData with 'image' file
Response: { prediction, confidence, all_detections, total_diseases }
POST /predict-yolo - First YOLO model only

POST /predict-yolo2 - Second YOLO model only

📊 Product Data Structure
Products are stored in `public/data/products.json`:

```json { "bud rot": [ { "name": "Fungicide Name", "url": "https://purchase-link.com" } ], "caterpillars": [ { "name": "Phoskill Insecticide-(Upl)", "url": "https://amzn.in/..." } ] } ```

🎨 UI Features
Glassmorphism Design: Modern frosted glass effect cards
Scroll Reveal Animations: Elements fade in as you scroll
Responsive Grid: Adapts to all screen sizes
Dark Theme: Easy on the eyes with green accents
Blurred Background: Beautiful coconut plantation imagery
🚨 Troubleshooting
Issue: "Models loading slowly"
Solution: Models are large files. First load takes time. Consider using Git LFS for faster clones.
Issue: "YOLO model not found"
Solution: Ensure `.pt` files are in `backend/` directory:
`backend/bestcoconutdisease.pt`
`backend/best.pt`
Issue: "API key errors"
Solution: Check `.env.local` exists and has correct API keys
Restart dev server after adding environment variables
Issue: "Flask CORS errors"
Solution: Make sure Flask is running on port 5000 and frontend on port 5173
Issue: "Products not showing in recommendations"
Solution: Check `public/data/products.json` format is correct
Verify disease names match (normalized matching included)
📦 Model Files
The YOLO model files are large (>100MB each). They are:

Not included in the repository (added to .gitignore)
Should be stored locally in the `backend/` folder
Can optionally be tracked with Git LFS
To add Git LFS support: ```bash git lfs install git lfs track "*.pt" git add .gitattributes git commit -m "Add Git LFS for model files" ```
