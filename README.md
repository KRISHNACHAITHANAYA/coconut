# Coconut 🥥

## Overview

Coconut is an AI Agents project repository inspired by the comprehensive collection at [500-AI-Agents-Projects](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/500-AI-Agents-Projects).

## About

This repository is designed to explore and implement AI agent technologies, frameworks, and use cases. AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Features

- **AI Agent Development**: Build and deploy intelligent agents
- **Multiple Agent Frameworks**: Support for various AI agent architectures
- **Integration Ready**: Easy integration with existing systems
- **Extensible**: Modular design for adding new capabilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher (recommended)
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with agent-based systems

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KRISHNACHAITHANAYA/coconut.git
cd coconut

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

```python
# Example usage (coming soon)
from coconut import Agent

# Create an agent
agent = Agent()

# Run the agent
agent.run()
```
