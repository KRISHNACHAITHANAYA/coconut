🌴 Coconut Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting diseases in coconut leaves using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The system classifies coconut leaf images into healthy and diseased categories and provides insights to support early disease identification for farmers and agricultural professionals.

Early detection helps reduce crop loss, improves yield, and enables timely treatment.
